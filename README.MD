# Solvd MERN Technical Interview

Welcome to the Solvd MERN Technical Interview! üöÄ This project is intended for technical interviews focused on MERN stack applications. 

In this case, this is the Senior level version of the project which will assess MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js experience.

For this, we will be using two projects:

1. Frontend using `React.js`
2. Backend using `Node.js`, `Express.js` and `MongoDB` which uses `mongoose` as its ORM.

Each of the projects has it's own `README` with more information in case of needing more detailed data on what to do.

# Objectives
- [Backend](server/README.md)
- [Frontend](app/README.md)


# Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/solvd-interviews/fullstack-interview-senior
```
2. Install frontend dependencies
```bash
cd app
yarn install
```
3. Start the frontend
```bash
yarn dev
```
4. Install backend dependencies
```bash
cd server
yarn install
```
5. Start the backend

The server is compiled and not using a hot-reload service so it should be restarted for it to use the code after modifying it.
```bash
yarn dev
```

# Paths

Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`

Backend: `http://localhost:4000`

Star Wars API: `https://swapi.dev` (In case of downtime, use `https://swapi.py4e.com/`)

MongoDB URI: `mongodb+srv://solvd-interviews:ypbBnypdyRymmKfg@solvd-interviews-cluste.xjkfbgq.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
